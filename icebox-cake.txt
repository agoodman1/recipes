Icebox cake
Serves 10-12

2 boxes of chocolate wafers (see note below) 
1 jar of seedless raspberry jam or another smooth jam
2 cups of heavy or whipping cream

Whip the cream until it forms firm peaks

Smooth a small amount of jam (maybe a teaspoon) on one side of each wafer; Smooth a small amount of whipped cream (maybe 2 teaspoons) on same side of wafer

Work on 5-8 wafers at a time; note that you can use broken wafers, if they are in large pieces – the whipped cream will hold the pieces together once you press them to the next wafer

Stack wafers on their sides in a line until you have used one box; the line of wafers should be about 10” long

Stack next set of wafers from second box alongside of first line of wafers to form a wider cake

Cover entire set of wafers with remaining whipped cream.

Chill for at least 6 hours.

When serving, cut the cake on the diagonal.

Chilling tip:  before covering the cake with saran wrap or tin foil, put a lot of toothpicks on the top and sides to prevent the saran wrap or foil from resting on the whipped cream.

Note:  Although they can be hard to find, there is no substitute for the chocolate wafers.  In Harris Teeter they are in a section of ice cream toppings, near frozen foods, with things like plastic bottles of chocolate and caramel sauces and boxes of ice cream cones; if they are not there in Harris Teeter, then they are probably out of them.  In a different store, you could also check the cookie section.  They come in a narrow yellow box with cellophane wrapping so you can see the wafers in the box.

Note that this recipe is on the side of the box of wafers; the only difference between that recipe and the one here is addition of the jam.
